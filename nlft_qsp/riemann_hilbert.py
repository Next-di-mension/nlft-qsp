def toeplitz(c: Polynomial, k: int):

    Note:
        Assuming that c is supported on :math:`(-\infty, n]`, this matrix will act as the linear operator :math:`f \mapsto z^k P (c z^{-k} f)`, where :math:`P` is the Cauchy projection annihilating any negative-degree term.

    approximated by `c`. The Toeplitz matrix will be computed using `toeplitz(c, k)`,
    see the documentation for `toeplitz` for more information.
